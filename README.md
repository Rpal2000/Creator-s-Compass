# Creator-s-Compass
A multimodal AI agent built with Gemini &amp; Opus that solves creators' core video problems. Users upload a link, and the system instantly analyzes lighting, audio, and framing to generate a Problem: Solution report. It features an auditable workflow, human review checks, and Qdrant-powered style recommendations.


💡 The Problem 
New content creators often struggle to meet production standards (poor lighting, bad audio, awkward framing), leading to low engagement and high dropout rates. Existing tools offer generic advice.✅ The SolutionCreator's Compass automates expert video analysis. A user submits a video URL, and the Opus workflow uses Gemini's multimodal capabilities to analyze the video at a granular level, delivering a structured, actionable report tailored to their specific goal.✨ Core Features (The Three Goals)Analyze & Blueprint (Goal 1): User submits a successful reference video. We output a step-by-step production guide on how to replicate that style and quality.Diagnose & Prescribe (Goal 2): User submits their own video. We output a Problem: Solution report focusing on their top technical flaws.Copy & Close the Gap (Goal 3 - Advanced): User submits their video. We use Qdrant to find a semantically similar, high-quality video from our database, and Gemini generates a direct "Gap Analysis" report on what changes are needed to match the professional template.🛠 Setup & Local Run Instructions1. Environment SetupClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/creators-compass-hackathon.git
cd creators-compass-hackathon
Create Environment File: Create a file named .env based on .env.example.Bash# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_KEY"
QDRANT_API_KEY="YOUR_QDRANT_CLOUD_KEY"
QDRANT_URL="YOUR_QDRANT_CLUSTER_URL"
Install Dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
2. Qdrant Setup (Pre-requisite for Goal 3)Action: Create a Qdrant Cloud cluster.Collection Name: video_blueprintsPayload: Each point stores metadata (title, style, lighting_setup_notes) and the vector (the embedding of the video's transcript/description).Note: Our Python script will rely on this collection being pre-populated with high-quality video embeddings.3. Run Local Test (Core Analysis)You can run the core Gemini analysis script locally to verify the structured JSON output.Bashpython src/main_opus_handler.py
(This demonstrates the heart of the project: the multimodal analysis and structured output generation.)🌉 Opus Workflow Integration (The Automation)The entire solution is orchestrated within a single Opus workflow, achieving a fully traceable and auditable automation pipeline.Intake Node: Captures the video URLs and the user's selected Goal.External Service Node (Python Backend):Goal 1 & 2: Calls the Python function perform_video_analysis (Step 2 in the workflow) to get the core analysis_json.Goal 3: The Python function executes a Qdrant API query (Step 5b) before calling Gemini for the comparative analysis.Decision Node: Checks analysis_json.overall_score. If $\text{Score} < 5$, it routes to the Human Review Node.Human Review Node: Ensures empathetic, high-quality feedback for low-scoring creators (Audit requirement).Code Node (Final Report Generation): Uses a secondary Gemini call to turn the structured JSON and Qdrant results into the final, human-readable report based on the selected Goal Template.Export Nodes: Sends the final report to the user (Email) and the full audit log (JSON artifact) to a secure location (Google Sheets/Cloud Storage).
